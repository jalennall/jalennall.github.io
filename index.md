## Welcome to GitHub Pages
While right now it is empty and bland, come back in 6 months or a year and see the progress and work I've done.
You gotta start somewhere. I've always been interested in computers and it took me till college to start to learn how to work
them besides the bare basics that any person with a computer would know. I can't imagine myself anywhere else!

### Here are some quotes that get me through the day
with music being such a massive inspiration in my life, I always pull quotes from my favorite artist.  
Here's a few of my favorites.  
>I was never really good at anything except for the ability to learn. - Kanye West  
>Own the day - FBZ  
>Criticism can bother you, but you should be more bothered if there’s no criticism. That means you’re too safe - Kanye West  
>“You don’t gotta be perfect, just keep it real.” - Post Malone  
> The World is Yours, Let Your Ambition Carry You Travis Scott
